Disconnect the ignition coil connectors and turn the ignition to Key ON Engine OFF (KOEO) position.

Perform Repair Validation.\n   - If the voltage is within specification, go to Step 1b.\nb. Remove the ignition coil(s) from the cylinder(s) identified by the Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC). Move the ignition coil to another cylinder. Perform Repair Validation.\n   - If a DTC is set for the cylinder where the ignition coil was moved, replace the ignition coil(s). Perform Repair Validation.\n   - If the same DTC is set, go to Step 1c.\nc. Remove the spark plug and inspect it. The spark gap should be 0.95–1.10 mm (0.037–0.043 in). Perform a quick compression check to determine if the compression is the root cause. Then, follow the appropriate diagnostic procedure and repair as specified. If compression, spark plug, and gap are good, move the spark plug to another cylinder. Perform Repair Validation.\n   - If a DTC is set for the cylinder where the spark plug was moved, replace the spark plug. Perform Repair Validation.\n   - If the same DTC is set, go to Step 2.\n2. Inspect the Fuel Injector\na. Disconnect the fuel injector connector. Using a DMM, measure the fuel injector resistance. The resistance should be 0.954–1.166 Ohms at 20°C (68°F)\n   - If the resistance is out of specification, replace the fuel injector. Perform Repair Validation.\n   - If the resistance is within specification, go to Step 2b.\nb. Using a mechanical ear (stethoscope), listen for the fuel injector clicking.\n   - If the fuel injector is not clicking, replace the fuel injector. Perform Repair Validation.\n   - If the fuel injector is clicking, inspect for a vacuum leak. If none are found, go to Step 2c.\nc. No fault is present. Perform Repair Validation.

Perform Repair Validation.\n   - If the voltage is within specification, go to Step 1b.\nb. Remove the ignition coil(s) from the cylinder(s) identified by the Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC). Move the ignition coil to another cylinder. Perform Repair Validation.\n   - If a DTC is set for the cylinder where the ignition coil was moved, replace the ignition coil(s). Perform Repair Validation.\n   - If the same DTC is set, go to Step 1c.\nc. Remove the spark plug and inspect it. The spark gap should be 0.95–1.10 mm (0.037–0.043 in). Perform a quick compression check to determine if the compression is the root cause. Then, follow the appropriate diagnostic procedure and repair as specified. If compression, spark plug, and gap are good, move the spark plug to another cylinder. Perform Repair Validation.\n   - If a DTC is set for the cylinder where the spark plug was moved, replace the spark plug. Perform Repair Validation.\n   - If the same DTC is set, go to Step 2.\n2. Inspect the Fuel Injector\na. Disconnect the fuel injector connector. Using a DMM, measure the fuel injector resistance. The resistance should be 0.954–1.166 Ohms at 20°C (68°F)\n   - If the resistance is out of specification, replace the fuel injector. Perform Repair Validation.\n   - If the resistance is within specification, go to Step 2b.\nb. Using a mechanical ear (stethoscope), listen for the fuel injector clicking.\n   - If the fuel injector is not clicking, replace the fuel injector. Perform Repair Validation.\n   - If the fuel injector is clicking, inspect for a vacuum leak. If none are found, go to Step 2c.\nc. No fault is present. Perform Repair Validation.
